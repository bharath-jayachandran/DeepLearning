# DeepLearning

Inspired by Fast.ai Mooc

## MNIST Keras Way

I have approached different models from simple Linear model to CNN to reach accuracy of 99.7%. Hope this useful !

1. Data Preparation

   1.1 Import Libraries
   
   1.2 Load Data
   
   1.3 Adjusting Dimensions
   
   1.4 Encoding Labels
   
   1.5 Normalizing Input
   
   1.6 Split Train and Test set
   
   
2. Linear Model

   2.1 Define the model
   
   2.2 Train the model
   
   2.3 Adjust the learning rate
   
   2.4 Train again with increased Epochs
   
3. CNN

   3.1 Define the model
   
   3.2 Train the model
   
   3.3 Data Augmentation
   
   3.4 Data Augmentation + Batch Normalization
   
   3.5 Data Augmentation + Batch Normalization + Dropout
   
   3.6 Ensembling
   
    

Used AWS EC2 P2xlarge Instance
